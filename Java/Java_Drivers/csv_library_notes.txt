Introduction

CsvJdbc is a read-only JDBC driver that uses Comma Separated Value (CSV) files or DBF files as database tables. It is ideal for writing data import programs or analyzing log files.

The driver enables a directory or a ZIP file containing CSV or DBF files to be accessed as though it were a database containing tables. However, as there is no real database management system behind the scenes, not all JDBC functionality is available.

Usage

The CsvJdbc driver is used just like any other JDBC driver:

download csvjdbc.jar and add it to the Java CLASSPATH.
load the driver class, (its full name is org.relique.jdbc.csv.CsvDriver)
use DriverManager to connect to the database (the directory or ZIP file)
create a statement object
use the statement object to execute an SQL SELECT query
the result of the query is a ResultSet
The following example puts the above steps into practice.

import java.sql.*;

public class DemoDriver
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    try
    {
      // Load the driver.
      Class.forName("org.relique.jdbc.csv.CsvDriver");

      // Create a connection. The first command line parameter is
      // the directory containing the .csv files.
      // A single connection is thread-safe for use by several threads.
      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:relique:csv:" + args[0]);

      // Create a Statement object to execute the query with.
      // A Statement is not thread-safe.
      Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

      // Select the ID and NAME columns from sample.csv
      ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT ID,NAME FROM sample");

      // Dump out the results to a CSV file with the same format
      // using CsvJdbc helper function
      boolean append = true;
      CsvDriver.writeToCsv(results, System.out, append);

      // Clean up
      conn.close();
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
